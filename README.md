# Image Semantics

With many image annotation formats existing in the field of computer visionl, it can become complated to manage different datasets in different formats. This package provided classes to convert and visualize different image semantics.

Image understanding is widely used in many areas like satellite imaging, robotic technologies, sensory networks, medical and biomedical imaging, intelligent transportation systems, etc. Recently semantic analysis has become an active research topic aimed at resolving the gap between low level image features and high level semantics which is a promoting approach in image understanding.
